# SFML_game
Survival 2D game using SFML
This is a learning project in which I made a game using C++ and SFML.
Special thanks to Suraj Sharma's youtube channel for his tutorials on SFML and game development.

It is currently a basic playable survival game. I am planning to add more features into the game and turn it into a fun and complete game.

Future works:
Player attributes and levels.
Different enemy types.
A proper world map and camera.
